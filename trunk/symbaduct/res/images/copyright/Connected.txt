Connected 
Day 2 - January 2, 2010
 
One of the themes of the movie Avatar is about how we are all connected beings. How each of us is linked by an intricate and highly complex root system.
 
The tube of lights at the center of the photograph reminds me of the synaptic connection that is created when a human "links" with his Na'vi counterpart. While the shower of bokeh are reminiscent of bioluminescent hangings from the Tree of Souls.
 
Although there is danger in reading too much into fiction, it is worth keeping in mind that we are all indeed connected one way or the other. Each action that we choose to make can directly/indirectly affect other people, things and/or beings - so let's make responsible choices in the course of living our lives to the fullest.
